    "Part of my work involves building a Windows apps that run powerful Python scripts for my users. I typically use [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to build the UI and I've been playing with the idea to automate the compilation step by using a CI/CD runner. I recently found out that you can spin up a Windows shared runner on Gitlab for free so I just had to test it out. Now the catch was that I wasn't close to my computer at the time but I had some time to kill. I had my phone with me so I thought let me see if I can build the whole thing using only my smartphone. I just want to build a very simple test app, so I can copy-paste code from the internet - it should be doable without my IDE right?\n",

I first tried editing it using the Gitlab web editor but that proved impossible - the web editor is not optimised for mobile devices so it was impossible to move around. I decided to us a document editor on my smartphone (Google Docs) instead. I copied the code there, made my changes and then copied it to Gitlab using the Gitlab web editor.\n",
